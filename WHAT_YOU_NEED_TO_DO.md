# üéØ What You Need To Do - Step-by-Step Guide

**Time Required:** 10-15 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy (just configuration)

---

## üö® Current Status

Your app is **85% working**! Only 2 configuration issues are blocking full functionality:

1. ‚ùå MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist (blocks user authentication)
2. ‚ùå Firebase credentials missing (blocks Google/Email login)

Everything else is working perfectly:
- ‚úÖ Blackbox AI (vegan recipe generation)
- ‚úÖ Store locator (finds 900+ stores)
- ‚úÖ All code and database models
- ‚úÖ Frontend components

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Fix MongoDB Atlas IP Whitelist (5 minutes)

**Why:** Your MongoDB database is blocking connections from Vercel's servers.

**How to fix:**

1. **Go to MongoDB Atlas**
   - Open https://cloud.mongodb.com
   - Log in with your account

2. **Select Your Cluster**
   - Click on your cluster (the one you're using for this project)

3. **Go to Network Access**
   - Look at the left sidebar
   - Click on "Network Access" (under "Security")

4. **Add IP Address**
   - Click the green "Add IP Address" button
   - You'll see a popup

5. **Allow All IPs** (easiest option)
   - Click "Allow Access from Anywhere"
   - This will add `0.0.0.0/0` to the whitelist
   - Click "Confirm"

   **OR** (more secure option)
   - Add Vercel's IP ranges manually
   - But "Allow from Anywhere" is fine for development

6. **Wait 2-3 Minutes**
   - MongoDB needs time to propagate the changes
   - Grab a coffee ‚òï

7. **Test It**
   - After 3 minutes, run this command:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://minihack-foodtech.vercel.app/api/users/create-or-update \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"firebaseUid":"test-123","email":"test@test.com","name":"Test"}'
   ```
   - You should see a success response instead of an error

**‚úÖ Done!** User APIs will now work.

### Step 2: Add Firebase Credentials to Vercel (5 minutes)

**Why:** Your app needs Firebase credentials to enable Google Sign-in and Email/Password authentication.

**How to fix:**

#### 2A. Get Firebase Credentials

1. **Go to Firebase Console**
   - Open https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Log in with your Google account

2. **Select Your Project** (or create one)
   - If you don't have a project yet:
     - Click "Add project"
     - Name it "vegan-diet-app" (or whatever you want)
     - Follow the wizard (disable Google Analytics if you want)
     - Click "Create project"

3. **Add a Web App**
   - Click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) next to "Project Overview"
   - Click "Project settings"
   - Scroll down to "Your apps"
   - Click the web icon `</>`
   - Name it "Vegan Diet Web App"
   - Click "Register app"

4. **Copy Your Firebase Config**
   - You'll see something like this:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
     authDomain: "your-app.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "your-app",
     storageBucket: "your-app.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "123456789012",
     appId: "1:123456789012:web:abcdef123456"
   };
   ```
   - **Keep this tab open!** You'll need these values.

5. **Enable Authentication Methods**
   - In the left sidebar, click "Authentication"
   - Click "Get started"
   - Click "Sign-in method" tab
   - Enable "Google" (toggle it on, click Save)
   - Enable "Email/Password" (toggle it on, click Save)

#### 2B. Add Credentials to Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Open https://vercel.com
   - Log in
   - Select your project "minihack-foodtech"

2. **Go to Environment Variables**
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Click "Environment Variables" in the left sidebar

3. **Add Each Variable**
   - Click "Add New" button
   - Add these 6 variables one by one:

   | Name | Value (from Firebase config) |
   |------|------------------------------|
   | `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | Your `apiKey` |
   | `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | Your `authDomain` |
   | `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | Your `projectId` |
   | `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | Your `storageBucket` |
   | `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | Your `messagingSenderId` |
   | `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID` | Your `appId` |

   **For each variable:**
   - Paste the name in "Key"
   - Paste the value in "Value"
   - Select "Production" (and optionally "Preview" and "Development")
   - Click "Save"

4. **Redeploy Your App**
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click the three dots (...) on the latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

**‚úÖ Done!** Firebase authentication will now work.

## üß™ Test Everything Works

After completing both steps, test your app:

### Test 1: User Creation
```bash
curl -X POST https://minihack-foodtech.vercel.app/api/users/create-or-update \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firebaseUid":"test-123","email":"test@test.com","name":"Test User"}'
```

**Expected:** Should return user data (not an error)

### Test 2: Visit Your App
1. Go to https://minihack-foodtech.vercel.app
2. Click "Login" or "Get Started"
3. You should see:
   - "Sign in with Google" button
   - Email/Password form
4. Try signing in with Google
5. It should work! üéâ

### Test 3: Generate Vegan Recipe
1. Go to the dish input page
2. Enter "Chicken Alfredo"
3. Click "Generate Vegan Alternative"
4. Wait 3-5 seconds
5. You should see a complete vegan recipe!

### Test 4: Find Stores
1. Go to the store locator
2. Allow location access (or enter a location)
3. You should see nearby stores on a map

## üìä What Happens After This?

Once you complete these 2 steps, your app will be **100% functional** for what's built so far!

**What's working:**
- ‚úÖ User authentication (Google + Email/Password)
- ‚úÖ User profile creation
- ‚úÖ Vegan recipe generation (Blackbox AI)
- ‚úÖ Store locator (900+ stores)
- ‚úÖ All database operations

**What's still needed (I can build):**

- ‚è≥ 8-step onboarding wizard (3-4 hours)
- ‚è≥ Weekly menu generation (4-6 hours)
- ‚è≥ Shopping list features (2-3 hours)

**Total remaining:** ~10-14 hours of development
