### **Frontend Integration**

#### Updated `frontend/src/services/api.js`
Added weeklyMenuAPI with 4 methods:
```javascript
export const weeklyMenuAPI = {
  generate: (firebaseUid) => api.post('/weekly-menu/generate', { firebaseUid }),
  getCurrent: (firebaseUid) => api.get('/weekly-menu/current', { params: { firebaseUid } }),
  swapMeal: (menuId, dayIndex, mealIndex, firebaseUid) => 
    api.post('/weekly-menu/swap-meal', { menuId, dayIndex, mealIndex, firebaseUid }),
  getShoppingList: (menuId, firebaseUid) => 
    api.post('/weekly-menu/shopping-list', { menuId, firebaseUid })
};
```

#### Updated `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- Added WeeklyMenu route
- Added navigation link (visible when logged in)
- Protected route requiring onboarding completion

---

## 🔧 Configuration Updates

### `vercel.json`
**Changes:**
- Added `functions` configuration with 60-second timeout
- Added explicit rewrites for all weekly-menu endpoints
- Ensures proper routing for nested API paths

**Why:** Vercel's default 10-second timeout is too short for AI menu generation (21 meals). Extended to 60 seconds to accommodate the processing time.

---

## 📊 Technical Specifications

### **Performance**
- Menu Generation: 30-60 seconds (21 AI-generated meals)
- Menu Retrieval: < 1 second
- Meal Swap: 3-5 seconds (1 AI-generated meal)
- Shopping List: 2-3 seconds

### **Data Flow**
1. User clicks "Generate Menu"
2. Frontend calls `/api/weekly-menu/generate`
3. Backend fetches user preferences
4. For each of 21 meals:
   - Generate AI prompt with preferences
   - Call Blackbox AI API
   - Parse response
   - Calculate nutrition
   - Adjust portions
5. Save complete menu to MongoDB
6. Return menu to frontend
