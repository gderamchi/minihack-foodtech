# ✅ Login Issue Fixed!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

**Problem:** API was receiving parameters in wrong order
- Expected: `createOrUpdate(userData, token)`
- Was sending: `createOrUpdate(token, userData)`

**Solution:** Fixed parameter order in:
1. `frontend/src/services/api.js` - API function signature
2. `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` - All calls to createOrUpdate

## 🚀 Deployment Status

✅ **Code pushed to GitHub** (commit: 58d8bd8)
