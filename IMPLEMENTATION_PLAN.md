## 💡 Technical Considerations

### Shopping List Persistence
```javascript
// Use MongoDB to store shopping list state
{
  userId: "...",
  weeklyMenuId: "...",
  items: [
    {
      ingredient: "Tomatoes",
      quantity: "500g",
      checked: false,
      store: "Whole Foods",
      category: "Produce",
      customNote: "Get organic"
    }
  ],
  customItems: [
    { name: "Paper towels", checked: true }
  ]
}
```

### Profile Updates
```javascript
// Trigger menu regeneration after significant changes
const significantChanges = [
  'dietaryRestrictions',
  'allergies',
  'cuisinePreferences',
  'householdSize'
];

if (changedFields.some(f => significantChanges.includes(f))) {
  promptMenuRegeneration();
}
```
