## 🔧 Performance Notes

### Cold Start
- First API request: 30-60 seconds (Vercel serverless cold start)
- Subsequent requests: 5-15 seconds
- This is normal for Vercel free tier

### Optimization Tips
1. Keep the site active (visit every 5 minutes)
2. Use Vercel Pro for faster cold starts
3. Implement caching for common dishes

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Function execution timeout"
**Solution:** This is normal for the first request. Wait 30-60 seconds.

### Issue: MongoDB connection errors
**Solution:** 
1. Check MONGODB_URI has actual password (not `<db_password>`)
2. Verify IP whitelist includes 0.0.0.0/0
3. Ensure database name is in the URI: `/vegan-diet-app?`

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution:** Should be resolved! All API calls are on same domain.

## 📈 Next Steps
