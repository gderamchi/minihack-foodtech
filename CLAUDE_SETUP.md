# Claude Sonnet 4.5 Menu Generation - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

The menu generation now uses **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (via Blackbox AI API) to generate **21 unique, personalized vegan recipes** based on user's questionnaire data.

**IMPORTANT:** Uses your existing BLACKBOX_API_KEY - no new API key needed!

### Features:
- **Personalized recipes** based on user preferences from onboarding
- **21 unique meals** (7 days √ó 3 meals per day)
- Each meal generated individually with Claude AI
- Uses user's dietary restrictions, allergies, favorite cuisines, cooking skill, time available, health goals, and budget
- Complete nutritional information for each meal
- Detailed ingredients with quantities
- Step-by-step cooking instructions

---

## ‚úÖ No Additional Setup Required!

**Good news:** This uses your existing `BLACKBOX_API_KEY` environment variable that's already configured in Vercel!

The Blackbox AI API provides access to Claude Sonnet 4.5 through the model: `blackboxai/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`

**Already configured:**
- ‚úÖ BLACKBOX_API_KEY (already in Vercel)
- ‚úÖ BLACKBOX_API_URL (defaults to https://api.blackbox.ai/chat/completions)
- ‚úÖ Model: blackboxai/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5

**Deployment:** Automatically deployed with commit 31c68cf
